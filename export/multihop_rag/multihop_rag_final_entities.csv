8 trusting prescott,PERSON,"8 trusting prescott is a tall task, even in what looks like a favorable matchup. the cowboys might pivot to a slower approach with tony pollard handling the run game more than he has been over the past couple of games. that could take pressure off of prescott, but it doesn ' t mean he ' ll unload statistically. i ' d rather start sam howell, jared goff and matthew stafford. last week : a nightmare scenario as prescott tried to get aggressive on downfield throws early and missed until he hit kavontae turpin for a 26 - yard touchdown. then prescott had to throw deep to try and climb back into the game and got sloppy on two of his interceptions ( a third bounced off of michael gallup ' s hands ). he didn ' t even play the last 12 minutes of the game and the cowboys got blown out. this season : prescott ' s completion rate is fine ( 69. 4 % ) and his off - target rate is low ( 8. 1 % ). so what ' s the problem? prescott ' s adot is 6. 5, ranking 28th among 33 qualifying quarterbacks. he ' s actually second - to - last in pass attempts of 10 - plus air yards ; only daniel jones has thrown fewer. and the scary part is that his adot was over a yard lower ( 5. 4 ) going into last week ' s game, so the cowboys tried to let him air it out and the plan completely backfired.",1078
