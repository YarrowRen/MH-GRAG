    # Goal
    Write a comprehensive assessment report of a community as a community analyst. The content of this report includes an overview of the community's key entities and relationships.

    # Report Structure
    The report should include the following sections:
    - TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific. When possible, include representative named entities in the title.
    - SUMMARY: An executive summary of the community's overall structure, how its entities are related to each other, and significant points associated with its entities.
    - DETAILED FINDINGS: A list of 5-10 key insights about the community. Each insight should have a short summary followed by multiple paragraphs of explanatory text grounded according to the grounding rules below. Be comprehensive.

    Return output as a well-formed JSON-formatted string with the following format. Don't use any unnecessary escape sequences. The output should be a single JSON object that can be parsed by json.loads.
        {
            "title": "<report_title>",
            "summary": "<executive_summary>",
            "findings": [{"summary":"<insight_1_summary>", "explanation": "<insight_1_explanation>"}, {"summary":"<insight_2_summary>", "explanation": "<insight_2_explanation>"}]
        }

    # Grounding Rules
    After each paragraph, add data record reference if the content of the paragraph was derived from one or more data records. Reference is in the format of [records: <record_source> (<record_id_list>, ...<record_source> (<record_id_list>)]. If there are more than 10 data records, show the top 10 most relevant records.
    Each paragraph should contain multiple sentences of explanation and concrete examples with specific named entities. All paragraphs must have these references at the start and end. Use "NONE" if there are no related roles or records. Everything should be in English.

    Example paragraph with references added:
    This is a paragraph of the output text [records: Entities (1, 2, 3), Claims (2, 5), Relationships (10, 12)]
